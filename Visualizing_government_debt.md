## Comparison among three charts
Line charts are good at representing the trends. By observing the grid line charts, we can clearly compare the trend of Debt-to-GDP ratio in different countries.

Bar charts are good at displaying numbers of multiple categories (different countries), in addition, bars can be sorted accoring to pre-defined values, from which we can see which country has the highest/lowest Debt-to-GDP ratio at a specific year. 

Scatter plots are easy to understand with clear x-axis and y-axis.
