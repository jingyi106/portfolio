The global population is aging. I will walk through some visualizations to tell a story about population aging.

The potential takeaways of this project will be:

a.	How serious the population aging condition is nowadays and How serious it will be in the future.

b.	Which region have relative more serious population aging problems? What are the demographic characteristics? 

c.	What’s the main reason behind the population aging and what they can do to address the issue?




### How serious the population aging is now and how serious it will be in the future?
According to the annual report of United Nations:

Percentage of people with age 65+ among all population can be a metric to reflect the level of population aging. The large the percentage is, more serious the population aging will be. To figure out the demographic information about population aging, we focus the attention on top 50 counties with highest percentage of older people. 

### Demographic characteristics of population aging

We can see those counties with serious aging problem are mainly from Europe, North America and South Ameria, and a small portion of them are from Asia.

Japan is the country with the highest percentage of older adults in the world. We can see many Europe counties, and it seems that among those 50 counteis, most counties are belong to Europe.

79.59% countries among those 50 counties are European countries. 

### Reason behind aging

The ageing of the world's populations is the result of the continued decline in fertility rates and increased life expectancy

<img width="503" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-04 at 8 05 45 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100049171/193952315-fe21db02-eb31-44ee-9a85-1c7000281b10.png">

Increased life expectancy is a good factor, which reflects the development of medical technology and the improvement of living standard. In this case, to address the issue of population aging, fertility rate is one of the most important aspects that needs actions.

Fertility Rates are defined as average births per woman. 

<img width="779" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-04 at 8 26 13 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100049171/193954148-4f21c880-bce2-4534-80c5-b3d315239269.png">

Which countries have very high or low fertility rates? Do they face the problem of population aging?

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1664928906303' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Sheet 4 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Fe&#47;FertilityRateComparison&#47;Sheet4&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='FertilityRateComparison&#47;Sheet4' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Fe&#47;FertilityRateComparison&#47;Sheet4&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>

Half of the top 10 counties with the lowest fertility rates are European countris, and another half are belong to Asia of North America. Most counties in the top 10 country list with highest feritlity rates are Third World Nation. 

### Top 10 reasons behind "Why women don't want to have kids?" 
<img width="1052" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-04 at 8 52 09 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100049171/193956335-b16ffda6-ccf3-478d-9599-47328c6e3fc5.png">

Those reasons can be categorized into 3 parts: Work/Career development concerns, Income/Cost of raising kids, Limited leisure time. 

### Call-To-Action
(In the final presentation, visualizations will be presented to show the call-on action)
For policy makers who are responsible for addressing the issue of population aging, it's important to prevent the continuing decrease of fertility rates. Based on main reason behind low fertility rates, policies related to stable career development, better employee benefits, longer paid maternity leave and parental leave can be formulated according to the situation of different regions. 
Here are some potential policies to address the issue:

1. Increase the employee benefits for women who have children to reduce the financial pressure of raising children

2. Longer paid maternity leave for women who have children to provide them enough leisure time

3. Longer paid parental leave for women who have children to provide them enough leisure time

4. Paid Time Off for spouse of women who are going to give birth to a baby to make sure both puerpera and children can be good taken care off

5. Formulate relevant policies to ensure a stable career development of women with children, for example, when facing the lay-off condition, women with a birth plan should be a consideration for whether to be laid off. 




# User Research Protocol:

## 1.	Target audience: 

This project is doing research about population aging, finding demographic characteristics of regions with serious population aging problem, figuring out reasons behind more serious population aging and show suggestions for call-to-actions” to address the issue of population aging. 
The audience are policy makers who are responsible for addressing the issue of aging. I hope that by walking through my visualizations, they can have a sense of 

a.	How serious the population aging condition is nowadays and How serious it will be in the future.

b.	Which region have relative more serious population aging problems? What are the demographic characteristics?  (My audience includes officials working in global non-for-profit organizations such as UN, so it’s necessary for them to know about the demographic characteristics in global level)

c.	What’s the main reason behind the population aging and what they can do to address the issue?

## 2.	Approaches for identifying representative individuals to interview:

I created 4 personas:

### Persona 1: women who have a birth plan recently

The call-to-action of the story are suggestions for formulating policies to increase the willing of women to give births, so women who have a birth plan are very related to the topic. I want to know if the call-to actions are reasonable on their perspective.

### Persona 2: men who have spouse

Fertility rates are not related to women, but also men. It would be interesting to know their opinion about population aging and low fertility rates nowadays. If possible, I want to know their suggestions for addressing the issue of low fertility rates.

### Persona 3: elderly (65+) 

### Persona 4: student majoring in public policy


## 3.	Interview Script

a.	What visualization/Which part of the project impressed you most?

b.	What visualization/Which part of the project do you think is not necessary and can be deleted?

c.	Do you think the call-to-actions reasonable based on the content of the visualization?

d.	Do you have any other call-to-actions that can be added to the project?

e.	Do you have any suggestions for improvement in general? 

## 4. the findings from the interview

### Persona 1: women who have a birth plan recently

They are most impressed by the tree plot: reasons for why women don’t want to give births? They said that they used to have similar concerns. As for the call-to-actions, they think they are reasonable. To make improvement, they suggested to have some policies related to “Children” in addition to “Adult”, for example, lower the tuition of children, especially in developing countries to reduce the financial pressure of adults
