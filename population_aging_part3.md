### Based on the feedback from user research in part 2, I have made the following updates to my final project:

1.	Delete the first histogram since it’s redundant. There is no elaboration after getting the conclusion that Japan is the country with the most serious aging problem, so there is no use to include that chart<br />
2.	The stacked histogram in part 2 is not clear enough for the audience to understand what I want to express, so in the final project, I added some explanations and comparations to show: Population aging is a reflection of the low fertility rate.<br />
3.	Add titles for each chart and citations below some charts to let the audience know the source is reliable.<br />
4.	Create more charts to convert my ideas in part 2 to visualizations that are easy for the audience to understand.<br />
5.	The call-to-actions are too broad, so I narrowed down the scope of call-to-actions and focus my attention on “the cost of raising a kid”.<br />

### Change 1: Delete the following histogram
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1664923157982' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='mostaging ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ra&#47;Rankofcountriesaccordingtoelderlypercentage&#47;mostaging&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Rankofcountriesaccordingtoelderlypercentage&#47;mostaging' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ra&#47;Rankofcountriesaccordingtoelderlypercentage&#47;mostaging&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>
<script type='text/javascript'> 
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1664923157982'); 
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px'; 
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; 
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement); 
</script>

There is no elaboration after getting the conclusion that Japan is the country with the most serious aging problem, so there is no use to include that chart.<br />

### 2: Add more explanations to the follwing histogram (title, source and explanations)
I listed the top 10 countries with the highest fertility rates and the top 10 countries with the lowest fertility rates. I want to show the demographic difference between those two groups, for example, most countries with the highest fertility rates are African countries while most of those with the lowest fertility rates areEuropean countries. Since European countries face the most significant population aging problems, a low fertility rate could lead to population aging. <br />

In part 2, I didn’t add a title and explainations to the chart 

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1664928906303' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Sheet 4 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Fe&#47;FertilityRateComparison&#47;Sheet4&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='FertilityRateComparison&#47;Sheet4' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Fe&#47;FertilityRateComparison&#47;Sheet4&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>  
<script type='text/javascript'>   
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1664928906303'); 
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; 
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>

In the final project, I added a title and subtitle to the chart and also included a paragraph to explain the takeaways from the visualization: <br />

### Change 3: Add titles to all charts and citations to some charts if the data is from external sources (you can see them in the shorthand)<br />

### Change 4: Create more charts to convert my ideas in part 2 to visualizations that are easy for the audience to understand.<br />

#### Change 4.1:<br />
In the final project, I added one interactive visualization to show the change in fertility rates of some countries from 1950 to 2020. The audience can view the change year by year by clicking the start button or dragging the slider.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/11454973"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

#### Change 4.2:<br />
I added a bubble chart to represent the three categories of reasons why people don’t want to have kids nowadays. Instead of printing out those words, I think it’s better to use simple visualization to catch the eyes of the audience. The larger the bubble means more important the category is.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/11454841"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

#### Change 4.3:<br />
In the final project, I narrowed my scope of call-to-actions and focused the attention on financial pressure, so I added one donut chart to show the cost composition of raising a kid.<br />

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11445194"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

### Change 5: The call-to-actions are too broad, so I narrowed down the scope of call-to-actions and focused my attention on the cost of raising a kid. <br />
After concluding that low fertility rates could lead to population aging, I switched the analysis to reasons why people don’t want to have kids. I listed the top 10 reasons in a tree map by analyzing the survey results released by New York Times.
The top 10 reasons are:
1. Want Leisure time<br />
2. Haven't found a partner<br />
3. No desire for children<br />
4. Can't afford childcare<br />
5. Can't afford a house<br />
6. Not sure I'd be a good parent<br />
7. Worried about the economy<br />
8. Global instability<br />
9. Career Concerns<br />
10. Work too much<br /><br />

After this step, I summarized those 10 reasons into 3 categories:
1. Career development concerns<br />
2. Financial pressure<br />
3. Leisure time concerns.<br />
Career development and leisure time are more related to personal lifestyle instead of social reality. Since my audience is policymakers, for them, the cost of raising kids could be one factor to consider and take actions<br /><br />

By analyzing the donut chart, housing, food, child care & education are 3 domains that families with children spent most money on. Suggestions are as follows:<br />
1.	Housing allowance for families with children<br />
2.	Free Meal Plan: Provide free or low-cost baby food for "new" parents; Conduct school lunch plan & dinner plan to reduce the food cost for families with children<br />
3.	Provide financial assist in Child Care & free education system<br />
