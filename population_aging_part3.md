Based on the feedback from user research in part 2, I have made the following updates to my final project:

1.	Delete the first histogram since it’s redundant. There is no elaboration after getting the conclusion that Japan is the country with the most serious aging problem, so there is no use to include that chart<br />
2.	The stacked histogram in part 2 is not clear enough for the audience to understand what I want to express, so in the final project, I added some explanations and comparations to show: Population aging is a reflection of the low fertility rate.<br />
3.	Add titles for each chart and citations below some charts to let the audience know the source is reliable.<br />
4.	Create more charts to convert my ideas in part 2 to visualizations that are easy for the audience to understand.<br />
5.	The call-to-actions are too broad, so I narrowed down the scope of call-to-actions and focus my attention on “the cost of raising a kid”.<br />
