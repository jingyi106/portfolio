## 1. Updates and changes according to the feeadback from user reaserach in part2<br />

1.	Delete the first histogram since it’s redundant. There is no elaboration after getting the conclusion that Japan is the country with the most serious aging problem, so there is no use to include that chart<br />
2.	The stacked histogram in part 2 is not clear enough for the audience to understand what I want to express, so in the final project, I added some explanations and comparations to show: Population aging is a reflection of the low fertility rate.<br />
3.	Add titles for each chart and citations below some charts to let the audience know the source is reliable.<br />
4.	Create more charts to convert my ideas in part 2 to visualizations that are easy for the audience to understand.<br />
5.	The call-to-actions are too broad, so I narrowed down the scope of call-to-actions and focus my attention on “the cost of raising a kid”.<br />

### Change 1: Delete the following histogram
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1664923157982' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='mostaging ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ra&#47;Rankofcountriesaccordingtoelderlypercentage&#47;mostaging&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Rankofcountriesaccordingtoelderlypercentage&#47;mostaging' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ra&#47;Rankofcountriesaccordingtoelderlypercentage&#47;mostaging&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>
<script type='text/javascript'> 
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1664923157982'); 
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px'; 
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; 
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement); 
</script>

There is no elaboration after getting the conclusion that Japan is the country with the most serious aging problem, so there is no use to include that chart.<br />

### Change 2: Add more explanations to the follwing histogram (title, source and explanations)
I listed the top 10 countries with the highest fertility rates and the top 10 countries with the lowest fertility rates. I want to show the demographic difference between those two groups, for example, most countries with the highest fertility rates are African countries while most of those with the lowest fertility rates areEuropean countries. Since European countries face the most significant population aging problems, a low fertility rate could lead to population aging. <br />

In part 2, I didn’t add a title and explainations to the chart 

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1664928906303' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Sheet 4 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Fe&#47;FertilityRateComparison&#47;Sheet4&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='FertilityRateComparison&#47;Sheet4' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Fe&#47;FertilityRateComparison&#47;Sheet4&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>  
<script type='text/javascript'>   
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1664928906303'); 
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; 
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>

In the final project, I added a title and subtitle to the chart and also included a paragraph to explain the takeaways from the visualization: <br />

<img width="900" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100049171/195473526-6e9f06cb-4796-4ad2-b7f7-99d4114bec69.png">


### Change 3: Add titles to all charts and citations to some charts if the data is from external sources (you can see them in the shorthand)<br />

### Change 4: Create more charts to convert my ideas in part 2 to visualizations that are easy for the audience to understand.<br />

#### Change 4.1:<br />
In the final project, I added one interactive visualization to show the change in fertility rates of some countries from 1950 to 2020. The audience can view the change year by year by clicking the start button or dragging the slider.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/11454973"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

#### Change 4.2:<br />
I added a bubble chart to represent the three categories of reasons why people don’t want to have kids nowadays. Instead of printing out those words, I think it’s better to use simple visualization to catch the eyes of the audience. The larger the bubble means more important the category is.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/11454841"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

#### Change 4.3:<br />
In the final project, I narrowed my scope of call-to-actions and focused the attention on financial pressure, so I added one donut chart to show the cost composition of raising a kid.<br />

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11445194"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

### Change 5: The call-to-actions are too broad, so I narrowed down the scope of call-to-actions and focused my attention on the cost of raising a kid. <br />
After concluding that low fertility rates could lead to population aging, I switched the analysis to reasons why people don’t want to have kids. I listed the top 10 reasons in a tree map by analyzing the survey results released by New York Times.
The top 10 reasons are:
1. Want Leisure time<br />
2. Haven't found a partner<br />
3. No desire for children<br />
4. Can't afford childcare<br />
5. Can't afford a house<br />
6. Not sure I'd be a good parent<br />
7. Worried about the economy<br />
8. Global instability<br />
9. Career Concerns<br />
10. Work too much<br /><br />

After this step, I summarized those 10 reasons into 3 categories:
1. Career development concerns<br />
2. Financial pressure<br />
3. Leisure time concerns.<br />
Career development and leisure time are more related to personal lifestyle instead of social reality. Since my audience is policymakers, for them, the cost of raising kids could be one factor to consider and take actions<br /><br />

By analyzing the donut chart, housing, food, child care & education are 3 domains that families with children spent most money on. Suggestions are as follows:<br />
1.	Housing allowance for families with children<br />
2.	Free Meal Plan: Provide free or low-cost baby food for "new" parents; Conduct school lunch plan & dinner plan to reduce the food cost for families with children<br />
3.	Provide financial assist in Child Care & free education system<br /><br />

## 2. Summay of my work in Part1 and Part2<br />
### [Part1: Brainstorming and initial sketches](/Project_Population_Aging_Jingyi.md) <br />
I picked population aging as the topic and talked about the background information to support why I choose this topic. Population aging is one of the most significant issues of the twenty-first century, so I want to utilize data analysis and visualization to convey insightful information to the audience: the policymakers. My initial sketches include time-series line charts to show the trend of population aging in the past 70 years, sorted bar charts to compare the population aging condition of different countries, map to give the audience interactive experience about which regions are facing serious population aging problems. In addition, I collected some data points in this part and had an initial idea about the medium I would use to present my work. <br />

### [Part2: Storyline creation and user research](/Population_Aging.md)  <br />
Since there is no clear storyline in part1, creating the story is the focus in part2. I created the storyline by firstly presenting three questions: <br/>
a. How serious the population aging condition is nowadays and How serious it will be in the future? <br />
b. Which region have relatively more serious population aging problems? What are the demographic characteristics?<br />
c. What’s the main reason behind the population aging and what actions can be done to address the issue?<br />
I created some visualizations according to those ideas, and provided call-to-actions to policymakers. <br />
In addition, I conducted user research in this part. 5 personas: women who have had a birth plan recently, men who have a spouse, elderly (65+), and students majoring in public policy. By interviewing with them, I got suggestions for addressing the issue of population aging from their perspectives. 

### Part 3: Updates according to feedback from the user research and finished the deliverable via Shorthand <br />
[Final Deliverable in shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/Population-Aging/index.html)<br />

## 3. Summary of main takeaways from this project<br />
### 1. Facts: <br />
#### 1.1 How serious the problem is and how serious it will be in the future?<br />
The world is aging. At the end of 2019, 1 in every 11 people are older than 65, and at the end of 2050, 1 in every 6 people is expected to be over 65.
#### 1.2 Demographic information about population aging. <br />
European countries are facing the most serious aging problems. Among the top 50 countries with the highest percentage of old adults, 39 countries are European countries.<br />

### 2. Causes:<br />
#### 2.1 Two main causes<br />
the continued decline in fertility rates and increased life expectancy<br />
#### 2.2 Low fertility rates situation<br />
Decreased fertility rate is one of the main reasons for population aging. For the last 70 years, fertility rates have decreased by 50% worldwide. People are less willing to give birth to a baby nowadays.<br />
#### 2.3 Reasons for the low fertility rates<br />
According to the survey conducted by New York Times, the top 10 reasons why people don’t want to have kids are: Want Leisure time, Haven't found partner
No desire for children, Can't afford child care, Can't afford a house, Not sure I'd be a good parent, Worried about the economy, Global instability, 
Career Concerns<br />

Those reasons can be summarized into 3 parts: career development concerns, financial pressure and less leisure time<br />


### 3. Solutions: 
#### 3.1 Cost of raising a kid<br />
"The cost of raising a child born in 2015 was $233,610. That assumes the child was born to a middle-income, married couple. When adjusted for inflation, the number jumps to $290,014 in 2022 dollars, based on the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics."<br />

Housing, Food, childcare & education are three aspects that a family spends most money on<br />

#### 3.2 Policy suggestions
Housing allowance for families with children<br />
Free Meal Plan: Provide free or low-cost baby food for "new" parents; Conduct school lunch plan & dinner plan to reduce the food cost for families with children<br />
Provide financial assistance in Child Care & free education system<br />
