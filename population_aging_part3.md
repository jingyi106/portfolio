### Based on the feedback from user research in part 2, I have made the following updates to my final project:

1.	Delete the first histogram since it’s redundant. There is no elaboration after getting the conclusion that Japan is the country with the most serious aging problem, so there is no use to include that chart<br />
2.	The stacked histogram in part 2 is not clear enough for the audience to understand what I want to express, so in the final project, I added some explanations and comparations to show: Population aging is a reflection of the low fertility rate.<br />
3.	Add titles for each chart and citations below some charts to let the audience know the source is reliable.<br />
4.	Create more charts to convert my ideas in part 2 to visualizations that are easy for the audience to understand.<br />
5.	The call-to-actions are too broad, so I narrowed down the scope of call-to-actions and focus my attention on “the cost of raising a kid”.<br />

### Change 1: I delete the following histogram
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1664923157982' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='mostaging ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ra&#47;Rankofcountriesaccordingtoelderlypercentage&#47;mostaging&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Rankofcountriesaccordingtoelderlypercentage&#47;mostaging' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ra&#47;Rankofcountriesaccordingtoelderlypercentage&#47;mostaging&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>
<script type='text/javascript'> 
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1664923157982'); 
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px'; 
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; 
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement); 
</script>

There is no elaboration after getting the conclusion that Japan is the country with the most serious aging problem, so there is no use to include that chart.<br />

### 2: add more explanations to the follwing histogram (title, source and explanations)
I listed the top 10 countries with the highest fertility rates and the top 10 countries with the lowest fertility rates. I want to show the demographic difference between those two groups, for example, most countries with the highest fertility rates are African countries while most of those with the lowest fertility rates areEuropean countries. Since European countries face the most significant population aging problems, a low fertility rate could lead to population aging. <br />

In part 2, I didn’t add a title and explainations to the chart
